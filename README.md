1. Using valid HTML and CSS, create a document with three-column layout. The left and right columns are fixed width, 180px and 200px respectively, and the middle column is liquid, expanding to fill the available space. Ensure that this code works in the top 3 browsers by market share. 

2. Write a short, HTML drop-down menu using native JavaScript to control its behavior (bonus points for reusability). The menu should begin with a single button that reveals a drop-down with 5 menu items when you hover over it. Hovering over one of the 5 menu items should reveal a second drop-down menu to the right of the original menu with an additional 5 items.
